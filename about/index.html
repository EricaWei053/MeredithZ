    Although she loves every minute of filmmaking, her greatest passion has always been editing. She believes that
    editing is some kind of magic that can shape stories and characters at will. So far, Meredith has more than five
    years of freelance video editing work experience with an impressive skill level in Adobe Premiere Pro.

    Her decision to become a video editor was inspired by Korean variety shows. These comedy shows gave her hope in
    her darkest period, so she also aspires to become a video creator who brings happiness to the audience.
